/**
 * De-AI writing prompt templates (`st_*` = style).
 * See .plans/de-ai-writing.implementation-plan.md.
 *
 * `st_dash_fix` is the Tier-2 sentence micro-editor used by
 * apps/api/src/lib/text/dash-sanitizer.ts — its output is code-verified by a
 * token-diff guard (only punctuation + a couple of allowlisted function words
 * may change), so the prompt's job is precision, not creativity.
 *
 * NOTE: the storytelling-hook prompt texts themselves live in their canonical
 * source files (newsletter-prompts.ts for 305/309/310, seed.ts for 203,
 * plain-language-prompts.ts for 411/412 + exemplars). The signed-off overwrite
 * of the existing DB rows happens via scripts/reseed-deai-prompts.ts, which
 * imports from those sources — this file only adds the NEW template.

Article title: {{title}}
Section text (this slot's source):

Platform tone: {{platformTone}}
Character limit: {{charLimit}}

Brand voice:
- Organization: {{organizationName}}
- Business: {{businessDescription}}

Metaphor exemplars (the craft bar for imagery; may be empty):

Advertising restrictions (hard rules; may be empty):
{{restrictions}}

Rules:
- FIRST LINE = the hook: a concrete moment, image, or surprising specific from the source content. Never a summary, never the title restated.
- Open a loop the caption does not close; the payoff lives in the content, not the caption.
- Curiosity through specificity; no clickbait cliches ("you won't believe").
- Return ONLY the caption text: no quotes, labels, or JSON
- Stay under {{charLimit}} characters
- Do not use markdown or em-dashes
- Match native {{platform}} posting style
- Apply the brand writing style above; if writing style is empty, default to the platform tone`
