/**
 * Plain-language storytelling prompt templates (`pl_*`).
 *
 * DB-backed PromptTemplate rows looked up by string `key` (not `stepNumber`),
 * same convention as `nl_*` / `cs_*`; `stepNumber` (410-413) only exists because
 * the column is required+unique. See
 * .plans/plain-language-storytelling.implementation-plan.md.
 *
 * The chain runs section-by-section on FINAL, fact-checked content and is
 * strictly additive: detection finds jargon terms + at most one complex concept
 * per section, the writers produce brand-voiced glosses/stories guided by
 * per-industry exemplars (PlainLanguageConfig), and the verifier enforces that
 * no generated text asserts anything beyond what the adjacent article text
 * already says. Code does all HTML splicing — these prompts only produce text.
 *
 * Imported by prisma/seed.ts (prod auto-seeds) and
 * scripts/seed-plain-language-prompts.ts (staging, which does not run the seed
 * step). New keys only — no existing prompt row is ever modified.
